The goal of our project is to design an application that allows a user to quickly and visually rate a player’s performance of a specific match.  To do this selected match events will be plotted on a graphical representation of a soccer pitch. The events can be filtered by type, by player and also temporally. Every pass, it’s direction, pass success rate, shots, goals and fouls for every player on the pitch will be recorded.
